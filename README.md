# Information system domain

## Project description

This project introduces the following topics:
• Data Engineering (Parallel and distributed DBMS, Object-relational and OO DBMS, Semi-structuriered modelling, NoSQL DBMS, Data integration) <br/>
• Web Engineering (Virtualization, Containertechnology, Cloudcomputing)<br/>
• Security Engineering (Basic security services, encryption, security protocols)<br/>


In practice this includes:

• Specification of an Information System<br/>
• Implementation IS based on relational DBMS<br/>
• Migration Relational-NoSQL<br/>



## Project implemetation


The implementation is split into three Milestones:


 ### Milestone 1 (Specification of IS) ###


<details>
<summary>Conceptual Modeling (of the chosen reality domain) </summary>
<p>
<summary>(large-scale) Business Model Outline/Description</summary>
<summary>Entity-Relationship model (Chen notation)</summary>
<summary>Use-Case Design (3 main and 2 elaborate Use-Cases)</summary>
	+ <summary>Detailed textual description</summary>
	+ <summary>Graphical representation of dynamics (UML Activity diagram or BPMN)</summary>



*Elaborate reporting / data analysis use-case must join at least 3 entities

</p>
</details>


### Milestone 2 (: Implementation of IS based on relational DBMS) ###


<details>
<summary>Configuration of Infrastructure</summary>
<p>
<summary>IS container composition and network isolation</summary>
<summary>Secure deployment (https, port exposure)</summary>
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Logical/Physical database design</summary>
<p>
<summary>Relational model and normalization</summary>
<summary>Implementation with relational DBMS</summary>
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Data import</summary>
<p>
<summary>Filling of tables via a programming language (e.g. Java and JDBC, HTTP/REST,…)</summary>
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Implementation Web system (relational DBMS)</summary>
<p>
<summary>Realization of 2 use cases per team member. A main business use case (needs to create some data) and an elaborate
		reporting / data analysis use case (needs to reflect the data created by the main use case) per team member</summary>
</p>
</details>



### Milestone 3 (Migration Relational-NoSQL) ###


<details>
<summary>NoSQL Database design</summary>
<p>
<summary>NoSQL design (collections, documents, indices, …)</summary>
<summary>Explain why your chosen design is the best performing for the implemented use cases (scalability, read/write ratio)</summary>
<summary>Show and compare the SELECT statements of both elaborate use cases from M2 to MongoDB query statements</summary>
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Data migration</summary>
<p>
<summary>Transfer of data via programming language (e.g. Java, Python, Ruby, …)</summary>
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Implementation IS (NoSQL)</summary>
<p>
<summary>Realization of all Use-Cases from Milestone 2 based on NoSQL DBMS</summary>
</p>
</details>
