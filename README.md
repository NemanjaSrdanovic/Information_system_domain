# Description

This project introduces the following topics:
• Data Engineering (Parallel and distributed DBMS, Object-relational and OO DBMS, Semi-structuriered modelling, NoSQL DBMS, Data integration) <br/>
• Web Engineering (Virtualization, Containertechnology, Cloudcomputing)<br/>
• Security Engineering (Basic security services, encryption, security protocols)<br/>


In practice this includes:

• Specification of an Information System<br/>
• Implementation IS based on relational DBMS<br/>
• Migration Relational-NoSQL<br/>


The implementation is split into three Milestones:


 ### Milestone 1 (Specification of IS) ###

Conceptual Modeling (of the chosen reality domain) which includes:
• (large-scale) Business Model Outline/Description <br/>
• Entity-Relationship model (Chen notation) <br/>
• Use-Case Design (3 main and 2 elaborate Use-Cases)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	• Detailed textual description<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	• Graphical representation of dynamics (UML Activity diagram or BPMN) <br/>


*Elaborate reporting / data analysis use-case must join at least 3 entities



### Milestone 2 (: Implementation of IS based on relational DBMS) ###


• Configuration of Infrastructure <br/>
	• IS container composition and network isolation<br/>
	• Secure deployment (https, port exposure) <br/>

• Logical/Physical database design <br/>
	• Relational model and normalization <br/>
	• Implementation with relational DBMS <br/>

• Data import <br/>
	• Filling of tables via a programming language (e.g. Java and JDBC, HTTP/REST,…)<br/>

• Implementation Web system (relational DBMS) <br/>
	• Realization of 2 use cases per team member. A main business use case (needs to create some data) and an elaborate
		reporting / data analysis use case (needs to reflect the data created by the main use case) per team member.<br/>



### Milestone 3 (Migration Relational-NoSQL) ###


• NoSQL Database design <br/>
	• NoSQL design (collections, documents, indices, …) <br/>
	• Explain why your chosen design is the best performing for the implemented use cases (scalability, read/write ratio, …) <br/>
	• Show and compare the SELECT statements of both elaborate use cases from M2 to MongoDB query statements <br/>

•  Data migration (5 points)<br/>
	• Transfer of data via programming language (e.g. Java, Python, Ruby, …)<br/>

•  Implementation IS (NoSQL) (5 points)<br/>
	• Realization of all Use-Cases from Milestone 2 based on NoSQL DBMS<br/>
